      "Humans beings have always been morbidly curious creatures – it’s why they continue to thrive in this modern era, so in a way, we have received the spirit of research from our ancestors through heredity.\r\nBut it has been seen that there is a dearth of enthusiasm among many engineering students to pursue a career in research and innovation, which can be attributed to a host of misconceptions and a general lack of exposure to the multifarious work opportunities in various research disciplines.\r\nTo dispel uncertainty about these opportunities, IEEE SB NITD brings forth POLARIS, a video series to introduce you to the world of exploration and scrutiny. We bring to you interview sessions with speakers having a range of diverse accomplishments in various positions. This series aims to challenge ancient assumptions and misconceptions and highlight the towering opportunities the field of RESEARCH offers.",
